It was developed as a result of the efforts of Ibm, particularly its researcher Edgar F. Codd,
who published a paper in 1970 titled "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks." In
In this article, Codd introduced the concept of a relational data model and proposed a language for
access and manipulate data in relational databases. */

-- Codds work laid the foundation for what later it would become SQL. *

/* Over the years, SQL has evolved and become a widely accepted standard for
relational database management. Here are some important milestones in the history of SQL. */

-- 1. 1970s

/* Ibm developed the first system based on the relational data model, called System R. They also presented
Sequel (Structured English Query Language), a language that laid the foundation for SQL. The name Sequel
later became SQL due to trademark issues. */

-- 2. 1980s

/* Several companies developed relational database management systems (Rdbms) based on SQL, such as
Oracle, Ingres and Sybase. The American National Standards Institute (Ansi) started to standardize SQL
in this decade. */

-- 3. 1990s

/* SQL became an Ansi standard and later an Iso standard. Relational databases and SQL became widely
popular in business and It applications software. */

-- 4. 2000s

/* With the rise of the web and the need for online databases, systems emerged more web-oriented
relational database management tools, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL. */

-- 5. 2010s and beyond

/* SQL continues to be a fundamental part of data management in a variety of applications and systems.
In addition to traditional Rdbms systems, SQL is used in NoSQL and NewSQL systems. */

/* SQL has become an essential language for managing and querying databases in a wide range of applications.
range of applications, from websites to business and scientific systems. The standardization of SQL has
contributed to its longevity and versatility, and remains a fundamental tool in the world of information
technology. */

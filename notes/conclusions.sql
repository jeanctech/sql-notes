--* Conclusions - SQL *

/* In SQL, conclusions are statements or results that are obtained from a query or data analysis in a
database. Conclusions can be fundamental for making decisions informed, make reports or extract insights
from the data. Here are some conclusions common ones that can be extracted when working with SQL. */

-- 1. Data Summary

/* Conclusions may include statistical summaries, such as averages, sums, maximums, minimums and totals
of data. These summaries provide an overview of the data characteristics. */

-- 2. Filtering and Delecting Data

/* SQL allows you to filter and select specific data that meets certain criteria. Conclusions can be
statements about the number of rows that satisfy certain filters. */

-- 3. **Data Aggregation

/* Conclusions may involve data aggregation, such as counting the number of records that meet certain
conditions or calculate average values. */

-- 4. Relationships Between Tables

/* SQL allows you to perform queries on multiple tables and find relationships between them. Conclusions
may include results from table joins and joins that reveal relevant information. */

-- 5. Trends and Patterns

/* By analyzing data series over time, you can identify trends and patterns. These conclusions can be
useful for decision making and planning. strategic. */

-- 6. Data Comparisons

/* SQL makes it easy to compare data, either between different periods of time, user groups or any other
relevant variable. Conclusions may include analysis comparatives. */

-- 7. Data Segmentation

/* By dividing the data into segments or groups, you can obtain conclusions about how different subsets
of data behave. */

-- 8. Summary of Sales and Financial_Performance

/* In commercial applications, the conclusions can include reports on sales, revenue, expenses and other
key financial indicators. */

-- 9. Anomaly Discovery

/* SQL can also be used to identify anomalous data or outliers, which can be valuable for fraud detection,
data quality issues, and more. */

-- 10. Projection and Predictions

/* Through data modeling and predictive analysis techniques, SQL can be used to make projections and
predictions about future events or trends. */

/* In short, SQL is a powerful tool for extracting and analyzing data in a database. The conclusions
derived from SQL queries are essential for decision making in a wide range of applications, from business
management to scientific research. These findings provide valuable information that helps you understand
the data and make the most of it effective way.

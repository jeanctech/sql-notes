--* Manage Indexes - SQL *

/* Managing indexes in a SQL database is an important part of optimizing database performance queries.
Indexes help speed data recovery by providing quick access to rows in a table based on the values in one
or more columns. Here are some concepts and tasks Common issues related to index management in SQL. */

-- 1. Create an index

-- You can create an index on a table using the SQL Create Index statement. For example:

      Create Index idx_index_name On table_name (column_name);

-- 2. Types of indexes

-- Database management systems (Dbms) offer various types of indexes, such as indexes simple, compound
-- indices, unique indices, full screen indices, among others. You must choose the suitable type according
-- to your needs.

-- 3. Delete an index

    -- If an index is no longer needed, you can delete it with the Drop Index statement:

      Drop Index index_name;

-- 4. Reorganize or rebuild indexes

  -- Over time, indexes can become fragmented and reduce their efficiency. Can reorganize or rebuild
  -- indexes to improve performance. The process varies depending on the Dbms.

-- 5. Index statistics

-- Maintaining accurate statistics about indexes is crucial for query performance. Statistics help the
-- query optimizer make informed decisions about how to access the data.

-- 6. Use of indexes

    -- The query optimizer uses indexes to determine the most efficient way to retrieve data. Make sure
    -- your queries are written in a way that they can take advantage of existing indexes.

-- 7. Monitor performance

-- You should monitor query performance and make adjustments to indexes as necessary necessary. Database
-- monitoring and performance analysis tools can be helpful For this task.

-- 8. Indexes and scripts

-- Keep in mind that while indexes can speed up reading data, they can also slow down write operations,
-- as they must be updated when rows are inserted, updated, or deleted.

-- 9. Primary and foreign keys

-- Primary and foreign keys usually automatically create indexes on the corresponding columns to ensure
-- referential integrity. Make sure these restrictions are maintained properly.

-- 10. Unique indices

-- Unique indexes ensure that there are no duplicates in a column. They can be useful to maintain data
-- integrity and improve efficiency in searches for unique values.

/* Index management is a critical part of database management and can mark the difference in query
performance. However, be careful not to create too many indexes, as this can increase maintenance cost
and slow down write operations You must carefully balance the number and type of indexes based on the
needs of your application. */

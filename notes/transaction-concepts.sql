--* Transaction Concepts - SQL *

/* In SQL, a transaction is a set of SQL operations that are executed together as a atomic unit, meaning
they are executed in their entirety or not executed at all. The Transactions are used to ensure the
integrity and consistency of data in a database. Here are some key concepts related to transactions in
SQL. */

-- 1. Transaction

/* A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations that are executed as a unit. Each transaction
must comply with the Acid principle (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability). */

-- 2. Atomicity

/* Atomicity ensures that a transaction is executed in its entirety or not at all absolutely. If an error
occurs during a transaction, all operations performed before the error They are rolled back to maintain
data consistency. */

-- 3. Consistency

/* Consistency guarantees that a transaction brings the database to a state valid to another valid state.
This means that a transaction cannot leave the database in a invalid intermediate state. */

-- 4. Isolation

/* Isolation refers to the degree to which a transaction is isolated from other transactions. concurrent
transactions. Different databases offer isolation levels, such as read uncommitted, read committed,
read-repeat, and serializable, which control how the Transactions see the changes made by other
transactions. */

-- 5. **Durability

/* Durability ensures that changes made by a transaction are permanent and persist even after a system
failure, such as a power outage. The data modified by a transaction must survive through system reboots. */

-- 6. Begin Transaction/Start Transaction

/* To start a transaction, you can use the statement SQL `Begin Transaction` or `Start Transaction`. This
marks the start of a transaction and any operation carried out afterward will be considered part of that
transaction. */

-- 7. Commit

/* The `Commit` statement is used to commit a transaction and make changes made in the transaction are
permanent in the database. After a `Commit`, the transaction is completed successfully. */

-- 8. Rollback

/* The `Rollback` statement is used to undo a transaction, which means that All changes made to the
transaction are undone. This is used in case of error or if you want cancel the transaction. */

-- 9. Saverpoint

/* A savepoint is a mark within a transaction that allows you to undo operations to that point, rather
than undoing the entire transaction. You can use `Savepoint` and `Rollback To Savepoint` to manage
specific parts of a transaction. */

-- 10. Point of No Return

/* It is the point within a transaction at which, if If you decide to commit it (using `Commit`), you
will no longer be able to undo it. Before reaching this point, you can roll back the transaction using
`Rollback`. */

/* Transactions are essential to ensure data integrity and consistency in transactions.
database operations, especially in multi-user environments where multiple transactions can
occur simultaneously. */

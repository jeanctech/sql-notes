/* Uses in Sql */

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used mainly to manage and
query relational databases. It has a wide range of applications and uses in the world of
data management. Some of the most common uses of Sql include.

1. **Data Query**: Sql is used to perform queries and extract data from a database.
You can use `Select` statements to retrieve specific information from tables.

2. **Data Insertion**: Sql allows adding new records to a database using
`Insert Into` statements. This is useful for adding new data to a table.

3. **Data Update**: Sql is used to modify existing records in a table using
`Update` statements. You can update values based on certain criteria.

4. **Deletion of Data**: Sql allows you to delete records from a table using statements
`Delete From`. This is useful for deleting data that is no longer needed.

database. You can create, modify, and delete users, as well as assign roles and privileges to them.

7. **Data Integrity**: Sql allows you to establish integrity restrictions on data to
ensure that certain rules are followed. This includes the definition of primary keys, foreign keys
and verification restrictions.

8. **Data Aggregation**: Sql provides aggregation functions, such as Sum, Avg, Count, Max and Min, which
They allow you to perform calculations on data sets, which is useful in reporting and data analysis.

9. **Subqueries and Joins**: Sql is used to perform complex queries that involve
subqueries and joins to combine data from multiple tables.

10. **Report Generation**: SQL is essential in the generation of reports and data analysis.
You can use Sql to extract data and present it in custom reports.

mobiles, Sql is used to manage data on the server side and synchronize it with applications
mobiles.

15. **Data Warehousing**: In data warehousing environments, SQL is used to consolidate and manage
large amounts of data for analysis.

These are just a few of the many uses of Sql in data management and manipulation. Sql is a
powerful and versatile tool used in a wide variety of applications and scenarios in the
world of technology and data management.
